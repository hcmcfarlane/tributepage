[CLICK HERE](https://hcmcfarlane.github.io/tributepage/) to see the page in action

This is a 'tribute page' challenge I completed as part of my pre-bootcamp work for the School of Codeâ€”which is to say, this is what I could do *before* 16 weeks of bootcamp. Just imagine what I can do now! Wait, no. Don't imagine itâ€”check out some of my other repos and see it for yourself!

## 7.2 - Your Tribute Page

You will now be using git and vscode to:

  * _clone_ your repository to your local machine (use the HTTPS link)

  * _update_ the sample HTML and CSS files with your own code (from CodePen) 

  * _add, commit and push_ your changes to your brand new repository. Pretty cool eh?

## 7.3 - Deploying your site using github Pages

Make sure that the deployed branch is `main` in settings.

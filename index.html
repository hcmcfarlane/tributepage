        <p><em>Do Go On</em> — colloquially, <em>do-goon</em> — was a 21st-century podcast that is credited with putting into motion the events that would become known today as ‘The Week of Yeah Nah That Was Pretty Good Hey’, which ultimately led to the progressive, poverty-free and peaceful 22nd-century utopia all of humanity now lives in. The long, complex and oft-times astonishing history of the originally billed ‘fact-based comedy podcast’ has spurred countless biopics, wikipedia-dot-orge holo-records, and of course, the trio’s bestselling tell-all memoir, <em>It’s Been 20 Minutes and I’m Only One Line into the Report</em>.<br /><span class="readmore"><a id="tribute-link" href="https://dogoonpod.com/" target="_blank">Read more ...</a></span> </p>
